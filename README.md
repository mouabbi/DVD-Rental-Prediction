# ðŸš€ DVD Rental Duration Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies regression models to predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regressors. The best model is selected based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) to ensure optimal predictions.

# Key Features:

- âœ… Data Preprocessing (Feature Engineering, Dummy Variables, Handling Dates)
- âœ… Regression Model Training & Evaluation (MSE < 3)
- âœ… Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
- âœ… Train/Test Split with 20% test data
- âœ… Best Model Selection
